# FAI Foster Care Website [Benson Cai]

This website is a simulation of your typical treatment planning process. 
You will have 30 minutes for each case,
please use this time to review case documentation as you see fit and develop a treatment plan 
including a clinical summary/narrative, goals, objectives, and interventions.
Your progress through the site will be collected for study purposes. 
As you go through this process, please continually verbalize your thought process 
as explained during the introduction.

For testing purposes, if something seems incorrect while using it, delete the localstorage and
the website should return to normal
(i.e. some of the functionality is based on localstorage values)
